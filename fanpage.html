        other singers back in the days who might try to look cute and sweet. she was more like a tomboy looking woman, who has a deep unique voice. 
        which some people might not favor by.
        but she is a woman who truthly shows herself on stage.  she was a caring woman, who treats her friends like families, 
        she doesn't treat money as important. She also actively involved in charitable projects 
        through out her career.Unforturnatly she died at the age of 40 due to cancer.
